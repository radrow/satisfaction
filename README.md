Rust was used as a programming language. If it is not already installed, [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is recommended.
Also the Iced framework requires _Vulkan_,_Metal_ or _DX11/12_ to be set up and _Cadical_ to be available globaly from the commandline. 

Libraries used:
[Iced](https://crates.io/crates/iced),
[Rand](https://crates.io/crates/rand),
[Cadical](https://crates.io/crates/cadical),
[Itertools](https://crates.io/crates/itertools)

To compile and run the program: `cargo run --release`.
