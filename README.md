# Rust/SAT-Solving

The project consists of three parts:

* __solver__:
    The library containing the code for the actual solver.

* __solver-cli__:
    A binary executing the solver via command line.
    Execute `cargo run --bin solver-cli` to run it.

* __tents__:
    A binary that uses SAT-solving to solve _Tents_-puzzles.
    Execute `cargo run --bin tents` to run it.
